project1 - Team 15
==================

This repository contains the required five programs for this project. To run programs
1-4, one need simply supply the necessary input parameters via the commandline:

    dimension       = size of the plate, or how fine we cut it
    topEdgeTemp     = the temperature at the top edge of our plate
    bottomEdgeTemp  = the temperature at the top edge of our plate
    leftEdgeTemp    = the temperature at the top edge of our plate
    rightEdgeTemp   = the temperature at the top edge of our plate

Sample command from the terminal:

    java Tpdahp -d # -l # -r # -t # -b #

As for the fifth program, it presents a GUI that allows for running simulations based
on the 4 original programs. It also allows for input of the parameters via the GUI.
